# ML-experiments
A few basic neural networks and my experiments in deep learning
## Convolutional Neural Networks
One basic shallow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been implemented and tried on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 Datasets
with the results:- 
* MNIST Dataset - 98.26% Accuracy and 98.24% F-Measure
* CIFAR-10 Dataset 
  * 58.1% Accuracy and 48% F-Measure in 25 Epochs (Probably still underfitting at that point)
  * 79.3% Accuracy and 78.8% F-Measure in 100 Epochs
  
A deep CNN was implemented on the CIFAR-10 Dataset

* CIFAR-10 Deep CNN - 44.17% Accuracy and 26% F-Measure in 100 Epochs (Either overfitting, or a gradient overshoot)
